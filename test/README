These tests are not meant to be comprehensive or fully automated. They
provide a quick sanity check of several use cases. The following
directories are provided for the following tests:

  * noreq       Test a build with no requirements on the Lua version.
  * minreq      Test a build which requires a minimum version (5.1).
  * minmaxreq   Test a build which requires a version range (>= 5.1, < 5.2).

For each type of test, the following interpreters are tried:

  * lua50
  * lua5.1
  * lua5.2
  * badinterp (Not actually a Lua interpreter)

The test assumes that all of these Luas are installed (interpreter, headers,
and libs). The exception is badinterp, which is not actually a Lua
interpreter, and is expected to fail. If they are not installed, the test
will print some FAILs which can be safely ignored.

The tests will also attempt to build some small example projects. They will
build a Lua module, and an executable with Lua embedded. See the tests for
more details.
